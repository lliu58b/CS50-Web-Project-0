# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is my personal website. I used bootstrap throughout the project, and included 4 pages:
home page, contact me, photography and calligraphy. Their names are pretty intuitive. All four of them
includes a bootstrap Jumbotron; home page includes three Cards, calligraphy page includes a table, and 
contact me page includes a picture and a list.

Most of the objects in this website is responsive, since I took advantage of the grid modal in the 
bootstrap. I have fulfilled all requirements stated in the handout. In this process, I used online
table generator to generate the html of my table used in calligraphy.
